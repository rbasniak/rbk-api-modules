DECISIONS MADE
---------------

- tenant to take place of domain
- library will support 1 db with multiple tenants or single db per tenant in a mixed scenario (configuration based) *** to be implemented
- claims are application wide in general, but there's also the possibility to create tenant specific claims
- roles can be either tenant wide or application wide
    * tenant roles will override application wide roles, and there will be a flag indicating it
    * global admin can manage application wide roles and local admins can manage tenant wide roles
- users are tenant wide and if needed, are duplicated in other tenants
- log/analytics/diagnostics will not be stored into separated databases, we'll use structured json logs instead
- user and session data will not be get from IHttpContextAccessor anymore, this information will be injected in a BaseCommand
- localization should be dynamic, allowing it to be setup at initialization and override for each request
- validations will be able to return an error code together with the message, enabling better handling by the BaseController
